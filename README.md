# emacs-config
Yet Another GNU Emacs Configuration.

The whole configuration is contained into the `dotemacs` file (that's
the `.emacs` file). Several packages are activated if they are detected
(like [helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm), [projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile), [company](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode), ...). It also uses a custom theme
named `clearview-light` (which can be modified using `M-xÂ custom-visit-theme`).

See the wiki for more details (under construction).
