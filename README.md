# emacs-config
Yet Another GNU Emacs Configuration.

The whole configuration is contained into the dotemacs file (that's
the .emacs file). Several packages are activated if they are detected
(like helm, projectile, company, ...). It also uses a custom theme
named clearview-light (which can be modified using M-x
custom-visit-theme).
